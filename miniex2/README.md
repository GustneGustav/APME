# The Spinning Beachball of Death v2: Alignment Boogaloo
---
This program is inspired by the infamous *Spinning Beachball of Death*, as known
and feared by many users of OSX. This is because the SBBOD
is associated with errors, crashes, freezes and glitches, which is neatly
in line with the subject of the exercise. This is a simple visual program
consisting of 25 3D-rendered boxes turning around themselves on the X, Y and Z
axis, producing a mesmerizing visual that slightly resembles the SBBOD. If the
mouse button is held down, the program will slow to a grinding halt. If the button
is released, the program will slowly recover and go back to normal.

### The coding process
The process was marked by a distinct lack of experience, as even the simplest
function or operation had to be looked up in the p5.js library referencebook.
Implementing one thing usually broke two other things, and the program had to
be kept simple to keep the workload down. The program serves no real purpose
and holds no profound message - but it does look nice.

### What is a program?
A program is an algorithm. It is a set of instructions for tasks to be
completed by the computer, carefully worded according to the grammar
of the programming language used, so that the computer can "read" it.

### What is an error?
An error happens when an insurmountable misunderstanding stops a program from
proceeding with the instructions it's been given.
The computers interpretative skills are limited, so if a single bracket or keyword
is missing from the code, it will not understand what it is reading. It has no
capacity to interpret what was meant, only what was written.
