### The program
This is a throbber. It doesn't throb, as such. It spins.
A throbber is a symbol for loading. It is an animated thingamajig going in circles, over and over, trying to convince us that it's working on something. It puts itself in stark contrast to the progress-bar of old, that would actually tell us how much was done and how much remained - but the throbber is timeless. Not in the traditional sense of the word, but in the sense that it tells us nothing about how long we have to wait before it's done. This particular throbber is a solar system! How cool is that? The tried and true dot-going-in-circles has been replaced by planets of all sizes and colours orbiting a sun. It took many hours and a lot of technical (and emotional) support from fellow students, but it works.

### The execution
The code is actually a modified version of the sample code used in the lecture before this exercise was due. A function that moves the 0,0 coordinate to the middle of the canvas and spins a big ol' ellipse around it indefinitely. Originally the function produced a "traditional" throbber, like the one we see on Youtube, Facebook, and everywhere else. Here, it has been adapted to represent a template "planet", and stuffed full of parameters representing size, distance from the center, speed and colour.

### Using programming to reflect upon (and inquire about) digital, visual culture
