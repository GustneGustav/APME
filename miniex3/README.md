### The program
This is a throbber. It doesn't throb, as such. It spins.
A throbber is a symbol for loading. It is an animated thingamajig going in circles, over and over, trying to convince us that it's working on something. It puts itself in stark contrast to the progress-bar of old, that would actually tell us how much was done and how much remained - but the throbber is timeless. Not in the traditional sense of the word, but in the sense that it tells us nothing about how long we have to wait before it's done. This particular throbber is a solar system! How cool is that? The tried and true dot-going-in-circles has been replaced by planets of all sizes and colours orbiting a sun. It took many hours and a lot of technical (and emotional) support from fellow students, but it works.

### The execution
The code is actually a modified version of the sample code used in the lecture before this exercise was due. A function that moves the 0,0 coordinate to the middle of the canvas and spins a big ol' ellipse around it indefinitely. Originally the function produced a "traditional" throbber, like the one we see on Youtube, Facebook, and everywhere else. Here, it has been adapted to represent a template "planet", and stuffed full of parameters representing size, distance from the center, speed and colour.

### Using programming to reflect upon (and inquire about) digital, visual culture
In the case of the throbber, the act of actually programming one has given way to reflection on the purpose it serves and why it looks the way it does. The throbber is (usually) just a looping animation - an indicator that something is happening behind the scenes, but not something we're given direct access to. This makes it a fairly simple thing to make. The progress bar that used to be the dominant symbol of loading, of processing, is comparatively complex, in the sense that it has to fetch information about the process it is representing - how much is done and how much remains (sometimes even calculating time remaining). Programming this throbber has made me think that, beyond just being a change in the flavour-of-the-week of digital symbols, the throbber represents a more significant shift in the way we consume digital content. The progress bar made sense in a world where the technical limitations of computers made waiting a significant issue, and in a time when computers, more than anything else, were tools. You told the computer to perform a task and waited for it to finish, and the progress bar fit the bill perfectly. But the way we consume digital content has changed radically over the years. We rely on more and more 'feeds' - streams of data, changing instantly and constantly. Tiny specks of data are transmitted, used and discarded in incredible numbers at incredible speed, and so gives way to the illusion of a continuous, amorphous stream - much in the same way that sand can be poured like liquid, even though it consists of many individual grains. In a broader perspective, programming and working 'under the hood' of software also gives a sense of tangibility to the othermise 'immaterial' fabric of software.
